- Connect with Dropbox or other cloud storage services are optional, you can download the formatted result on Costflow dashboard.
- If cloud storage services are connected, Costflow will limit itself can only get application-specific data.
- Costflow will use "append to file" API without opening your ledger files.
- Your ledger files will only be downloaded to our server when you create new entries, and they will be deleted in a few hours automatically.
- The "[include](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAMVrKIA2qtRGmoVDSUBJGmYZSygUaR0uOMW1GV3YE0/edit#heading=h.86lelow4097r)" command is encouraged to use, so you don't need to put all your ledger files in Costflow's app folder.
