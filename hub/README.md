# Costflow Hub

Costflow Hub is a product that allows users to create plain text accounting entries (use [Costflow Syntax](/syntax/)) from their favorite messaging apps, such as Telegram, Facebook Messenger, etc. Then Costflow Hub can sync the formatted entries to your local ledger file with the help of Cloud Storage services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.

That means you can create accounting entries on your **Mac, PC, iPhone, Android phones**, or whatever devices that messaging apps exist.
